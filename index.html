    <h2>View changes for a sheet</h2>

    <p>Compressed view - this shows only changes submitted by users. This helps you focus on how the sheet has changed and by whom.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on a cell to see the version history for that cell.</li>
        <li>Cells are highglighted if they were modified by multiple different users. This aids in finding contention such as if a user overwrote another user's value. </p></li>
    </ul>
    <table id="deltaGrid" border=1></table>

    <p>Version history for this cell:</p>
    <table id="deltasPerCel" border=1></table>

    <p>Deltas by user</p>
